**So many options, so little time to choose**. Container configurations, server set up decisions and setting out your new ml project can be so time consuming. 

A power feature behind MLDock is it's support for production-ready boilerplate machine learning docker projects. In fact, it's core the mldock as a command line tool. All projects are created from a base template, where the default is provided by MLDock command line.

1. Create a new `project` from an `existing template`
2. Create a new `template` from an `existing container project`
